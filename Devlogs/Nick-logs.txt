1/3-1/5/2024:
Not much was done other than trying to figure out how to go about the creation of this.

1/6-1/8/2024:
I got all the necessary programs up and running allowing me to code. This was downloading
all the componants to make my-react-app work. When all the installs 
and pathing was done I got to work. I made my own branch and tested out how to use javascript 
and webpages. I made a simple file for testing via grants previous work to help me gain 
knowledge on the code. I eventually understood it leaving it there as I got sick...very sick.

1/10:
I restarted my work to be in line with everyone elses. I also left behind my branch to 
avoid any merging pains. Createclass was made with simple code trying to use colors like 
jeremy's and grant's. JoinClass was done the same. CreateClass has a simple 2 prompt input 
for a teacher to fill in to create their class. Join class has one prompt if they are joining 
a class and a view classes section to see other classes they already have. I also made 
a label box from grant's header box to allow for smaller uses of simple labels. 
I used one such case in the joinClass file.

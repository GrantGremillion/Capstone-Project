I agree with your statement, and also, another aspect is the intersection of free speech with other rights, like privacy. Celebrities posting about others on their social media can sometimes violate on privacy rights. This was highlighted in the Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker Media case, where Hogan sued Gawker for releasing a private video. it underscores the legal boundaries of what can be shared online, even under the disguise of free speech. When a celebrity makes a controversial statement online, they might face backlash in the form of public opinion, loss of sponsorships, or professional opportunities. This social reaction is not a legal sanction but a reflection of the broader social and economic implications of free speech. While free speech is a fundamental right, it comes with the responsibility to consider the broader consequences of one's words, especially in the highly interconnected and public forum of the internet.

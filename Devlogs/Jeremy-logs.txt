Devlogs file for team member Jeremy Wood.

SPRINT 1

8 January 2024:
Put together basic files for my user stories. Coppied the layout of the home page for now, will edit it and actually "make"
the pages later. No issues to report besides a general lack of knowledge on the subject, but that is to be expected since 
I am learning basically 2 new languages and a specific framework for website design.

9 January 2024:
Tonight is the Tuesday presumably before the sprint is due (I sent an email to Bowman for clarification), so I went ahead 
and fully edited my files (UserProfile and UserAccountSettings) to match the homepage's look. As a summary for what I have 
done:
- Added a call to FormGroup and FormControl to handle Switches with lables
- Changed function calls for the buttons to reflect that only the front-end is developed
- Matched design of homepage 
    - this means a lot of moving around and making new HTML components

Also added the Devlogs file and made the inital text files for the team. 
Work for this sprint (for me) is basically done (except the Wiki, I'll do that tomorrow before class since it'll be quick).
